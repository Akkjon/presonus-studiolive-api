## Events

```js
import { MESSAGETYPES } from 'presonus-studiolive-api'

// Listen for changes to settings
<Client>.on(MESSAGETYPES.Setting, function(data) {
    console.log(data)
})
```

> or

```js
// Listen for changes to settings
<Client>.on("PV", (data) => {
    console.log(data)
})
```

Events are split into data events and lifecycle events.  

* Callbacks / handlers can be applied onto specific events, given by their [message type](#enum-messagetypes).
* To listen to **all events**, you can listen to the `data` event
* To listen to **meter events**, you can listen to the `meter` event (see [Metering](#metering))

### Lifecycle Events

```js
client.on('connected', () => {
    console.log("Connected to the device!")
})
```

To trigger a function when client has successfully connected to the console, listen to the `connected` event.  

```js
client.connect().then(() => {
    console.log("Also connected to the device!)
})
```

Note: The `<Client>.connect(...)` function returns a Promise and is therefore thenable, so you may simply just use `.then(cb)` to continue execution after connection
