## Events

Events are split into data events and lifecycle events.  

* Callbacks / handlers can be applied onto specific events, given by their [message type](#enum-MESSAGETYPES).
* To listen to all events, you can listen to the `data` event
* To listen to meter events, you can listen to the `meter` event

```js
// Listen for changes to settings
<Client>.on(MESSAGETYPES.Setting, function(data) {
    console.log(data)
})
```

```js
// Listen for changes to settings
<Client.on("PV", (data) => {
    console.log(data)
})>
```

### Lifecycle Events

* `connected` - Emitted when the client has successfully connected to the console
