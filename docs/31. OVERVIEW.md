* TCP connections are used for control
  * The console listens on TCP port `53000`
* UDP connections are used for metering data
  * The client opens up a UDP server on a random port
  * The client notifies the console of the port

* Every 3 seconds, the console emits a Discovery packet
* The client sends a KeepAlive packet every few seconds 

* When the client connects it sends a Hello and Subscribe message to the console
  * The console replies with a SubscriptionReply and Zlib data containing the console state
