PreSonus StudioLive III API
---

An unofficial API for the StudioLive III consoles from PreSonus.  

Initial protocol research was done in Python, and can be found in the [`research_python`](https://github.com/featherbear/presonus-studiolive-api/tree/research_python) branch.  
The Python client currently has more functionality than the Node.js API.
