Hey there! ðŸ¥³

If you can read this, you've either found this page [online](https://featherbear.cc/presonus-studiolive-api), or from the API's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/featherbear/presonus-studiolive-api)

This repository contains my API implementation and protocol research of the undocumented PreSonus UCNET network control protocol for StudioLive Series III consoles.  

For the best experience, please view this [online version](https://featherbear.cc/presonus-studiolive-api)
