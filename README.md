Hey there! ðŸ¥³

If you can read this, you've either found this page [online](https://featherbear.cc/presonus-studiolive-api), or via my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/featherbear/presonus-studiolive-api)

This page/repo outlines my research and implementation of the undocumented PreSonus UCNET network control protocol.

## Research

Protocol research was performed on a _StudioLive Series III 16R rack mixer_, _StudioLive Series III 24R rack mixer_ and a _StudioLive Series III 16 console_, using the [UC Surface](https://www.presonus.com/products/UC-Surface) application on Android and Windows.
