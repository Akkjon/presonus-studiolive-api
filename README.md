Hey there! ðŸ¥³

If you can read this, you've either found this page [online](https://featherbear.cc/presonus-studiolive-api), or via my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/featherbear/presonus-studiolive-api)

This page/repo outlines my research and implementation of the undocumented PreSonus StudioLive Series III network control protocol.

## API

The majority of you probably have stumbled upon this page because you've wanted some sort of integration with your StudioLive console.

## Research

Protocol research was performed on a _StudioLive Series III 24R rack mixer_ and a _StudioLive Series III 16 console_, using the [UC Surface](https://www.presonus.com/products/UC-Surface) application on an Android and Windows device. You can read more about my research at the link below
